We might need to rebuild the `irs_record` applet. If we do, some of the pieces:
- see if makes sense to make it a child of a larger `irs` applet or _family_
- tackle the data management from start to finish

The user should be able to:
- start using the application immediately when offline, at least starting from an 'overview' page
- view an overview or summary of their recent activity and current options
- add a record of activity, much like making a note - not requiring any given clusters, location, etc


# Data flows and data needs for point-based offline data collection
(describing this might be the biggest win!)

This assumes the simplest set of requirements, including that the tool requires **NO** knowledge of clusters or spatial_entities.

## Starting knowledge
- [ ] form schema
- [ ] user 

The user should be able to start filling a form, without the tool having any prior knowledge of (ie requirements for data about), current network state, previous activity, location or date. 

## Working knowledge

## Passing-on knowledge
