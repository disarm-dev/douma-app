# Planning

Levels:
- Target level
- Selection level

The levels come from the spatial hierarchies.

We have a target level. This is what we want to get denominator from and use on the monitor page.

We have a selection level. It must be above the target level.

We need to calcualte aggregations for all levels above the target level.

The IRS Tasker uses the target level.
