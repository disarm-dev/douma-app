# Set custom api url

It is possible to set a custom api url using two enviroment variables.

`CUSTOM_STAGING_API_URL` is used for the staging api url. 
`CUSTOM_PRODUCTION_API_URL` is used for the production api url. 

If no custom urls are set, douma-app will fallback to using standard disarm api urls.
