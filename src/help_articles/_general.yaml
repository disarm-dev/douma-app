- title: Reloading and updating
  content: >
    - DiSARM is designed to run offline in a robust way that protects your data.

    - In general, you can try reloading any page that looks like it's stuck loading (click the reload button on your browser).
    If you're editing a form, you may lose your entry unless you save first.

    - If DISARM is online, it will check to see if there's a new version available. If there is, it will download and update in the background, letting you know
    when it's ready.
    Sometimes (due to a slow connection or other issue), the update doesn't work.


    - If things get stuck on a desktop browser, you can try a "force reload", which is `ctrl+shift+r` on Windows (`cmd+shift+r` on Mac).
    This will try to re-download the required application files and start up again. Your data (except unsaved forms) will not be removed.

    Note that if you somehow logout when you are offline, you won't be able to use DiSARM again until you login
    (which you can only do if you're online).

- title: Offline functionality
  content: Offline functionality is primarily designed to work for the IRS Record componenent, which allows users to collect data out in the field offline.
           Other parts of the application may work offline, however these are not fully functional.

- title: Data usage
  content: >
    - DiSARM is designed to use the smallest possible amount of data. As far as possible, base files are only downloaded once.


    - For the simplest use (access to `Record` only), we only need to download the application, which is less than 2 Mb.


    - Syncing records is around 10 Kb for sending 100 for responses, but with a minimum size of 1Kb per sync - i.e. syncing 1 record is still 1 Kb.


    - For the base data used in the `Plan`, `Tasker` and `Monitor` components, we need some 'geodata'. Depending on the instance, this can be between 2.5 Mb and 7 Mb.
      But _this should only need to be downloaded once_.

    - Once you're up and running with either the simpler `Record` component (~ 2Mb), or one of the more advanced mapping components (~ 9Mb), you should be able
      to restart the application without needing to load any more data.
